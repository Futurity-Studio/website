With the growing population and the environmental impact of our current agriculture system, a growing body of technologies is trying to address the issue of how to feed the next billion, sustainably. Plantable Meals envisions how we might re-engineer plants to grow all the ingredients, including culturing meat cells in plant scaffolding, within a single plant for an entire meal.",

Starting by studying the science of synthetic biology and startups pursuing these existing but immature technologies, we extrapolated how they might be combined in a future when they are mature products and need to differentiate themselves - a common pattern in innovation. To forecast this future, we looked at:",

              "Shortcomings of today’s technology. While today’s startups have been able to reproduce even complex flavors of animal-based meat, its texture remains difficult to replicate; plants have been proposed as a scaffold. The need for fetal bovine serum (FBS) to grow cells means that the products are not truly animal-free, but vegetal serum could provide an alternative. And an exciting promise - the ability to create novel combinations such as beef with healthy oils rich in omega-3s, for example - has not yet been realized; plant fats like olive oil could easily substitute.",
              "Trends likely to persist or emerge. Convenience, health, novel flavors and sustainability are long-term trends in consumer preference, so we set out to address all four with the new offering. At the same time, vertical farming and in-home agriculture could take off."
