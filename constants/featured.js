With the growing population and the environmental impact of our current agriculture system, a growing body of technologies is trying to address the issue of how to feed the next billion, sustainably. Plantable Meals envisions how we might re-engineer plants to grow all the ingredients, including culturing meat cells in plant scaffolding, within a single plant for an entire meal.",

              "Shortcomings of today’s technology. While today’s startups have been able to reproduce even complex flavors of animal-based meat, its texture remains difficult to replicate; plants have been proposed as a scaffold. The need for fetal bovine serum (FBS) to grow cells means that the products are not truly animal-free, but vegetal serum could provide an alternative. And an exciting promise - the ability to create novel combinations such as beef with healthy oils rich in omega-3s, for example - has not yet been realized; plant fats like olive oil could easily substitute.",
              "Trends likely to persist or emerge. Convenience, health, novel flavors and sustainability are long-term trends in consumer preference, so we set out to address all four with the new offering. At the same time, vertical farming and in-home agriculture could take off."

This transfer happens without the contents being co-opted by third parties or incurring unnecessary expense of time, energy, money or material. The transaction membrane improves the lives of the people inside, as well as the environment and society outside. Concord is a speculative design concept in 2040, an instantiation of the Transaction Membrane. As a result of mass-consumption and its consequences, the parameters for purchasing have shifted to a more sustainable, local and responsible manner. The project speculates the infrastructure of an autonomous agent designed for individual commerce. It proactively takes care of everyday needs; to better align your transactions with health, social, financial, and ecological values. The exhibition showcases Concord in a kitchen interaction.",

Whether delivered by ground or flying drones, human messager, or even a pipe-based subterranean infrastructure, Concord is built to connect with a variety of supply chain logistics.
