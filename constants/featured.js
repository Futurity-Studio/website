It keeps your data on edge-based devices in your home, not on a server. Concorde agents coordinate anonymously with other owners in your region to create a distributed ledger of current and future demand. Concord is a series of interconnected modular kitchen appliances that fulfill every necessary kitchen function. These modules connect and work together to maximize the efficiency of products in and waste out. Concord is an interface of a transaction membrane—an architecture exchange space where items enter or leave a dwelling."

This transfer happens without the contents being co-opted by third parties or incurring unnecessary expense of time, energy, money or material. The transaction membrane improves the lives of the people inside, as well as the environment and society outside. Concord is a speculative design concept in 2040, an instantiation of the Transaction Membrane. As a result of mass-consumption and its consequences, the parameters for purchasing have shifted to a more sustainable, local and responsible manner. The project speculates the infrastructure of an autonomous agent designed for individual commerce. It proactively takes care of everyday needs; to better align your transactions with health, social, financial, and ecological values. The exhibition showcases Concord in a kitchen interaction.",
